	<h2>Learn More</h2>
<p>The network of friends, family, neighbours, schoolmates and others is a highly meaningful set of friendships. Showing their relationships to each other can help you understand how networks work and maybe help you learn a little about how your social world fits together. Different people have different clusters in their networks, as well as different brokers that link everyone together. If you have a significant other, chances are they will be tied to several groups. If you have your high school friends on Facebook, chances are they will be tightly linked together as many of them are friends of friends.</p>

	<p>NameGenWeb is hosted at the <a href="http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk" target="_top">Oxford Internet Institute</a>. Funding for this version of the program has been provided by the Teaching Excellence Award through the University of Oxford. Current codebase is maintained by Joshua Melville. Project Coordinator is Dr Bernie Hogan. </p> 

	<h4>Pending Features</h4>
	<p>NameGenWeb is under construction. At present we currently only render a plain blue node network. We have plans for the following features. You can request other features by emailing us. </p>
	<ul>
	<li>Color coded nodes based on different communities clusters. </li>
	<li>Export network diagram to post to your wall.</li>
	</ul>
